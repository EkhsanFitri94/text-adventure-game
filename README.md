A simple text-based adventure game created as my first project while learning Python fundamentals.

How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing game.py.
4. Run the command: python game.py

How to Play

- Type commands like right, ahead, back, or forward to move between rooms.
- In certain rooms, you can interact with objects by typing the name of the exit (e.g., open the chest).
- Type quit at any time to exit the game.
- The goal is to find the treasure room!

Game Updates (v2)

- Added a new "garden" room to discover.
